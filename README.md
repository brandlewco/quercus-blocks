# Bare-bones Nextjs starter

**Next.js is incredible in its simplicity and flexibility;** there are less prescriptive guiderails placed on developers in the implementation of an app or site. 

## Clone the starter

``` javascript
// clone the repo from your terminal
$ git clone git@github.com:kendallstrautman/nextjs-blog-starter.git <project name>

// install the dependencies
$ cd <project name>
$ yarn install

// start up the dev server
$ yarn dev
```

Once you are able to clone the project and start the dev server successfully, navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser to see what we're working with.
